# Shopping Kart

Project inspired from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart).

Built a simple ecommerce shopping cart front-end using React, and added client-side routing using React Router. The cart is populated with a hard coded array, however it could be easily replaced with a API call or JSON. And the user can add items to the cart, remove items from the cart, and view the cart at any time. Checking out will simply display a message and empty the cart.

One of the main goals of this project was to learn how to use React Router to create a single page application. I also learned how to use React (router) Context to manage state and pass data between components.

What I skipped: Testing using vitest or jest. I focused on getting familiar with the React Router and Context API. Maybe I will add testing later, or maybe not. But testing will be a priority in future projects.
