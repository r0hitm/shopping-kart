# Shopping Kart

Project inspired from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart).

Project Goal: Learn to use react router and get familiar with the concept of a single page application

A *dummy* ecommerce shopping cart front-end using React, and added client-side routing using React Router. The cart is populated with a hard coded array, however it could be easily replaced with a API call or JSON. And the user can add items to the cart, remove items from the cart, and view the cart at any time. Checking out will simply display a message and empty the cart.
